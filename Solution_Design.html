            <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
            <ul class="project-requirements">
                <li><strong>Battery Life:</strong> The device must be capable of delivering 24 hours of continuous use under a 25W power load, verified through endurance testing with real-world workloads.</li>
                <li><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> The exterior of the container must achieve an IP68 rating, ensuring it is dustproof and capable of being submerged in water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes without any water ingress.</li>
                <li><strong>Water-Resistant Internals:</strong> The internal components, including circuit boards, wiring, and connectors, must be coated with a conformal waterproof layer capable of withstanding splashes and exposure to high humidity (up to 90%) without damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Cursor Input:</strong> The secondary input device, such as a joystick or trackpad, must be responsive and functional, allowing the user to control the cursor within 1mm of precision and operate at a latency of less than 50ms.</li>
                <li><strong>Buoyancy:</strong> The container must float on water, maintaining at least 50% of its volume above the surface when fully loaded with components and batteries, verified through buoyancy tests in fresh and saltwater environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Battery Storage:</strong> The compartment for a secondary battery must be sized to fit a standardized lithium-ion battery pack with a capacity of at least 10,000 mAh, allowing for easy swapping without tools in less than 30 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>SD Card Storage:</strong> The SD card compartment must be capable of securely holding a minimum of 5 standard-size SD cards, each in its own slot to prevent misplacement or damage during transport.</li>
                <li><strong>Retractable USB-C Cable:</strong> The retractable USB-C cable must extend to a minimum of 1 meter, support fast charging at 60W, and retract fully into the case without external loops or tangling.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanical Keyboard:</strong> The full-size mechanical keyboard must have at least 84 keys, with a key switch rated for 50 million presses, ensuring it withstands heavy use. The keyboard must also be able to operate in temperatures ranging from -10°C to 50°C.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Output:</strong> The built-in speakers must produce a minimum volume of 75 dB at 1 meter, with frequency response from 100Hz to 20kHz, ensuring clear audio playback in noisy outdoor conditions.</li>
