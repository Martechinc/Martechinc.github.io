            <!-- Patent 1 -->
            <h3>Patent 1</h3>
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> Google. (n.d.). US7047113B1 - GPS Navigation device. Google Patents.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A navigation device for navigating a vehicle to a point comprises a GPS receiver for receiving GPS signals, a processor connected with the receiver for processing the GPS signals, navigation data created by the processor, and a display page. The navigation data includes ground speed, altitude, vertical speed, and rate of turn information, and the display page presents this information in individual graphic, circular displays representative of an aircraft instrument panel.</p>
            <p>In an alternative form, the device is portable and may be placed in an air, water, or land mode where the display page displays information directed toward aeronautical, marine, or automotive navigation, respectively. For example, in the air mode, a graphic, circular track display is presented on the display page. Cartographic data stored in the memory of the device may also be displayed on the display page in the form of a moving aeronautical-type map indicating progress toward the point.</p>
            <p><strong>Critique:</strong> This patent for a navigational chart plotter proves that having a reliable system implemented into boats is a bare necessity. The failure of this system could prove fatal as it is the basis of knowing where you are located without any obvious indicators.</p>

            <!-- Patent 2 -->
            <h3>Patent 2</h3>
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> Google. (n.d.-b). US9405333B1 - Method and System for Rugged Tablet PC Based Modular Data Acquisition. Google Patents. 
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9405333B1/en?q=%28rugged%2Bcomputer%29&oq=rugged%2Bcomputer">

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The invention describes a rugged tablet PC that can be combined with a data acquisition chassis to create a rugged modular data acquisition tablet computer. The data acquisition chassis has a top, middle, and bottom housing section that enclose the data acquisition circuitry and modules. An interface plate with a gasket is used to seal the data acquisition chassis to the rugged tablet PC. The invention also describes methods for modifying the data acquisition chassis housing to fit the rugged tablet PC and for attaching the chassis to the tablet using standoffs and fasteners.</p>
            <p><strong>Critique:</strong> This patent shows how to build a rugged personal computer that could withstand the shocks and vibrations of everyday use. This could also apply to marine use cases as there is a lot of unexpected motions, vibrations, and shifts that the device would need to endure to prevent failure and increase reliability.</p>

            <!-- Patent 3 -->
            <h3>Patent 3</h3>
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> Google. (n.d.-c). US9405333B1 - Method and System for Rugged Tablet PC Based Modular Data Acquisition. Google Patents. 
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9405333B1/en?q=%28rugged%2Bcomputer%29&oq=rugged%2Bcomputer">

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The patent describes an on-board navigation system that uses building position and height data to identify GPS satellites unaffected by multipath, enabling highly accurate vehicle positioning. When few unaffected satellites are available, it uses self-contained navigation and map matching for accurate guidance.</p>
            <p><strong>Critique:</strong> This patent shows how GPS technology can be reliably used to get an accurate position of a device during any given moment. This also shows how it can be integrated into a downloaded map.</p>
