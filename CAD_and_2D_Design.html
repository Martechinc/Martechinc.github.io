            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>
                I chose to use Fusion 360 for this project due to my extensive experience with it in previous projects. Although other CAD software like Onshape is more accessible, Fusion 360 offers unmatched versatility. It integrates numerous functions such as rendering, animations, and simulations. This enables me to consolidate all my work within a single platform, which is particularly advantageous as the project grows in complexity.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                The design began with the concept of interlocking plates that would allow for easy future waterproofing. The border seal of the design is intended to be plastic welded directly onto the case, which enables a secure fit for the faceplate. This faceplate is designed to provide protection from external elements while offering mounting points for electronic components. The integration of these elements eliminates the need for additional mounting points that could compromise the structural integrity of the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the faceplate allows for the backplate to be mounted securely. This backplate is designed to hold the screen against the faceplate, thus creating a waterproof seal. To enhance the durability of the design, the backplate is attached to the front plate using TPU spacers that reduce vibration. This backplate serves as an adapter for the Raspberry Pi and the display, ensuring that all components fit seamlessly within the overall structure.

            <h2>Waterproofing</h2>
            <p>
                The interlocking plates play a crucial role in the waterproofing process by providing flat surfaces that overlap. This overlapping design facilitates the potential addition of gaskets and seals in the future, enhancing the waterproof capabilities of the case. One of the key concepts explored for this design is the inclusion of an internal pressure gauge, which serves as a safety measure for testing the waterproofing integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea is based on the principle that if air can remain inside a sealed container, it is an indicator of waterproofing. By using a small external hand air pump (such as a basketball pump), the internal pressure of the computer case can be increased. Monitoring the pressure gauge then allows for checking if there is any pressure loss. A drop in pressure would indicate that the seal is not properly secured and that adjustments are needed.

            <h2>2D Design</h2>
            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>
                Although I had no prior experience with 2D design software, I chose to use Affinity. It is known to be complex for beginners, but I found that starting with a more challenging option helped me learn more effectively. This mirrors my experience with learning Fusion 360, where diving into a complex software environment accelerated my skill development.

            <h3>2D Design Walkthrough</h3>
            <p>
                The design of the logo was guided by a simple yet modern approach, combining my three initials (MAM) into a sleek monochromatic style. The intention behind this design was to create a logo that doesn't immediately reveal the initials, allowing those familiar with the brand to recognize the hidden meaning.
            </p>
            <h3>Progression</h3>
            <p>
                The design process began with a sketch created in Notability, which I later refined using the Sketchbook app on my iPad. After finalizing the features, I imported the sketch into Fusion 360 for tracing. This traced sketch was then exported as a DXF file into Affinity, where it was refined further to be cut as vinyl.
