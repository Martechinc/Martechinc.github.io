            <h3>○ Software</h3>
            <p>
                ■ For software, I chose to use Fusion 360 as I have a lot of experience using it from previous projects. I am aware that there are more accessible CAD software options out there, such as Onshape. The reason I chose to go with Fusion 360 is because of its unparalleled versatility. Fusion 360 has many functions integrated that Onshape may not have, such as rendering, animations, simulations, and more. This allows me to concentrate all my work in one software, which will be beneficial as this project becomes more complex.

            <h2>● Design</h2>
            <p>
                ○ The design started off with the idea of interlocking plates that can allow for easy future waterproofing.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>■ The border seal would be plastic welded straight to the case.</li>
                <li>
                    ● This would allow the faceplate to mount to the straight border and provide mounting points for the faceplate.
                </li>
                <li>■ The faceplate will provide sealing from the outside world and provide mounting points for any electronics, getting rid of the necessity for mounting points that would compromise the integrity of the case.</li>
                <li>● The faceplate also allows for the backplate to be mounted, which will hold the screen against the faceplate to create a waterproof seal.</li>
                <li>■ The backplate screws into the front plate with vibration-reducing TPU spacers.</li>
                <li>● The backplate functions as an adapter for the Raspberry Pi and display.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>● Waterproofing</h2>
            <p>
                ○ The interlocking plates facilitate the waterproofing through flat faces that the plates can overlap on.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>■ The overlapping faces allow for future use of gaskets and seals for waterproofing.</li>
                <li>■ Idea for an internal pressure gauge, which serves as a safety check of the waterproofing.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>● Using the concept that if air can stay inside a container, then it is waterproof.</li>
                    <li>● By pressurizing the internals with a small pump (likely an external hand air pump, such as a basketball pump), the inside of the computer case can gain pressure.</li>
                    <li>○ By monitoring the gauge and seeing if the pressure drops, this indicates that it was not sealed correctly.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>● 2D Design</h2>
            <h3>○ Software</h3>
            <p>
                ■ I don't have any experience using 2D design software, yet I chose to use Affinity. It may seem contradictory, as it is very complex for beginners like myself. However, starting with the more complex option forces me to learn how to use it, which is how I learned to use Fusion 360.

            <h3>○ 2D Design walkthrough</h3>
            <p>■ Reasoning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>● The logo is a combination of my three initials (MAM) curated in a modern monochromatic style.</li>
                <li>○ The logo is not meant to convey the three initials at first glance.</li>
                <li>■ It was made so that people who understand its meaning can find the three initials.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>■ Progression</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>● The design first started off as a sketch in Notability.</li>
                <li>● The design was then refined on Sketchbook on my iPad.</li>
                <li>● Once I had my heart set on its features, I put it into Fusion 360 to trace the logo.</li>
                <li>● The traced sketch was exported into Affinity as a DXF file and filled in to be cut as vinyl.</li>
