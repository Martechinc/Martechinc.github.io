            <h2>3D Printing</h2>
            <p>
                The 3D printed mini project had the following requirement:
            </p>
            <ul class="project-requirements">
                <li>
                    <strong>Objective:</strong> Design and print a 3D model that cannot be conventionally made using subtractive methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Subtractive methods cannot create internal structures and details, unlike additive methods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A popular design seen in the additive community is the "ball in a cage." The ball has a diameter larger than any opening on the cage's sides, making it impossible to produce with subtractive methods.
            </p>
            <div class="aboutmeimg">

            </div>
            <p>
                After extruding the walls of the cage and performing a revolve function, the completed design was achieved:
            </p>

            <h2>3D Scanning</h2>
            <p>
                3D scanning involves using a combination of light, infrared, and lidar to recreate a structure digitally as a mesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the final project, a black weatherproof case with slight curves and bends posed challenges for accurate measurements. The black surface caused the scanner to lose track of its location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflective stickers were used to provide features that helped the scanner better map the object in 3D. This improved the scanning process:
